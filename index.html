			<h2> My studies</h2>
			<ol class="list-inline">
				<li>
					<p>Fistly, I'm a student in IÉSEG School of Management in La Défense campus (near Paris). I'm currently in Master (4th year) in Finance. All my classes are taught in English. This formation will probably lead me to bank or audit compagnies for my future job.</p>

					<p>Additionally, I'm enrolled in La Facultée Catholique de Lille, in Paris campus, to complete a diploma in "iniation aux droit des affaires". It's 2-year cursus, to discover the basis of business law. I started this program 1 month ago, and for now I'm really satisfied by the formation. </p>

					<p>Finally, last year I studied abroad in Cornell University located in the US (NY states). I stayed 1 semester, and the life there was amazing, I experience the life in an American campus (and it was like in the movie) </p>

			<h2>What I want to do next</h2>
			<p>For my professional future, I don't exactly know what I want to do. Today, I wish that I'll start my own business but I still don't have concrete idea. Because of this lack of inspiration, I focusing on financial jobs (more linked with studies). For now, I really like asset management, I think I will try to get an experience in this field in I have no idea of business. </p>
